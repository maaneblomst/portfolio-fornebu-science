                <img src="images/exhibitions/cosmology.jpg" alt="a dark picture of a black hole in the galaxy">
                <p>Explore the wonders of our cosmos. Our fantastic exhibition, ‘The Sky Above Us’, explores the night
                    sky and what we can see and know about the universe around us. We’ll locate the various
                    constellations and galaxies that can be seen and learn a bit about the early navigators who used the
                    stars to travel by. Follow the journey of our solar exploration: from early Arab traders, to
                    Galileo’s telescope, to the latest exploration of the planets in our solar system.

                <h2>Evolution</h2>

                    alt="a mockup of the evolution theory: five people standing in line demonstrating five steps of the evolution">
                <p>For centuries, philosophers and scientists have wrestled with the question of our origins. Where do
                    we come from and how did we get here? Since Darwin proposed his theory of evolution we have had a
                    framework for exploring and understanding our place in this world. Discover the origins of life on
                    this planet and how the species we know today have evolved our time. You can also take some time to
                    meet a few of the creatures who didn’t survive, including our Woolly Mammoth, the Dodos, and a
                    number of dinosaurs too.

                <h2>Biology and Medicine</h2>
                <img src="images/exhibitions/biology.jpg"
                    alt="a picture of a professor with work gear looking at micro-organisms">
                <p>From micro-organisms to the human body, major breakthroughs in biology are offering us unique
                    insights into the great wonders of the tiny world. For many people their life expectancy is much
                    longer and their quality of life much improved, thanks to the growth of our understanding of
                    medicine. Over a series of exhibits we explore the history of medicine and take a look at some major
                    breakthroughs including the discovery of penicillin and the first heart transplant. Many of our
                    great medicinal discoveries have come not only from the lab, but also from observing animals in the
                    wild. Often our fellow creatures have beat us to it.

                <p>The information revolution is here and robotics and artificial intelligence are the science of the
                    future. From useful home applications of AI to industrial uses of robotics, the future is here. You
                    can even say hello and shake the hand of Rob the Robot.</p>

                    alt="two hands holding soil and a sprouting seed over green grass">
                <p>As we learn more and more of the impact humans are having on the planet, the more important it
                    becomes that scientists explore how to create a sustainable future not just for humans but for the
                    whole planet. In our ecology section of the museum, we unpack the dangers we currently face
                    including global warming, extinction of species, and pollution. But we also focus on the positive
                    ways we can all contribute to a brighter future.
