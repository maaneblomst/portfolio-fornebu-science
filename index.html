                        <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed from our early understanding of fire,
                            wind, water, and earth to exploring everything from galaxies far away to the very building
                            blocks of life itself.The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
                            experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion to
                            continue the exploration of the world around us.

                        <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through
                            exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects
                            of science to explore. Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and
                            play around to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits – they only
                            come to life at night when everyone’s gone home).</p>

                    <p>It is our pleasure to announce that Prof Sheila Widnall from the Massachusetts Institute of
                        Technology will be delivering 3 lectures on the development of aeronautics and where the
                        future lies in this exciting ‘space’.</p>

                    <p>Get your family together for an exciting night in the museum as you sleep over beside
                        dinosaurs and science displays. Bring your own sleeping bag and get ready to rough it as we
                        go exploring the wonders of science.</p>
                    <h3>Energetica Exhibition on Loan</h3>
                    <img src="images/events/energetica.jpg">
                    <p>On loan from the NEMO Science Museum in Amsterdam, the Energetica exhibition is coming to the
                        Community Science Museum. It’s a series of installations that allow visitors to experience
                        the power of the elements as we harness them. From solar energy powering lighting, to ‘Wind
                        Island’ that shows how turbines are able to use and control wind to create power.</p>
